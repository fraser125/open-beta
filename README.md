The Drone is a portable open source game controller that is platform agnostic. One controller for all your gaming whether it be on a Smartphone, SmartTV, Tablet, PC or Mac. Write custom configs, learn to code and update the firmware. The Drone is meant to get smarter and smarter and can even emulate other controllers on the market.
